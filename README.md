# Lir #

Lir is a set of tools developed in the area of computational electromagnetics, by the RF Modelling and Simulation Group in the RINCE Institute, Dublin City University and licensed under the Apache License.

The initial version of Lir has been developed by Ian Kavanagh as part of his PhD under the guidance of Dr. Conor Brennan. It consists of a full wave 2D and 3D indoor propagation modelling tool. It is planned to expand Lir to include tools for producing time domain information as well as modelling urban and rural environments.
